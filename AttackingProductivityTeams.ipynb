It looks at goal differences (G-xG) and assist differences (A-xA) of players to better understand the varying attacking profiles of Premier League clubs in the 2022-2023 season, identifying the clinical finishers and unlucky playmakers.\n",
        "<br><br>\n",
        "Again, to focus on key attacking players, I filter the dataset down to the 190 players who have more than 3 attacking contributions (goals + assists). Additionally, statistics are calculated by player AND club, making it possible for some players to have two separate set of metrics. For example, January transfer Leandro Trossard has an xG for his performance at Brighton and at Arsenal."

It suggests that the player has been efficient or clinical in converting their opportunities into goals.\n",

It suggests that the player has strong teammates to convert their passes into assists by scoring.\n",
